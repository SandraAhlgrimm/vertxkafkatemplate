# vertxkafkatemplate
Kafka Consumer and optional Kafka Producer written with Vert.x


Developing projects with vertx is real fun!
Especially when you realize the effectiveness and all - or at least - some advantages of vertx!

This project gives you a frame for a kafka consumer including the access via Routematcher and it deploys and undeploys Workerverticles(and also Verticles). 

## control

To start the project you can use the .bat file after the build. The deploy- and undeployment of the Workerverticle is realized via http-requests.
